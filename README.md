# 👋 Hi there! I'm Tiago 😁

🎓 I'm currently studying **Engineering in Informatics** and working on building a strong foundation in software development.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- 💻 Programming: **Python (intermediate)**, **Java (learning)**
- 🧠 Still learning: Java basics, algorithms, data structures
- 🔧 IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA (with educational license)
- 🐧 Red Hat Academy Labs (RHEL VM user)

## 📂 Projects & Learning Journey

- 🔹 I've built several mini Python programs exploring the language’s features.
- 🔸 I developed a medium-sized **project manager app** in Python that allowed users to assign tasks and track progress.
- 🧩 Currently adapting Python exercises to **Java** as a way to deepen my understanding.
- 📚 Exploring core computer science topics and academic projects across multiple subjects.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Java programming fundamentals
- Programming paradigms like **Object-Oriented Programming** (not formally studied yet, but I’m familiar with the concepts)
- Best practices in Git and GitHub

## 🧑‍💼 Experience

While I don’t have formal experience in the IT industry (yet!), I’ve worked in a **family-owned grocery store and butcher shop**, where I took on a wide variety of responsibilities:

- Handling the cash register and customer service
- Managing invoices and supplier accounts
- Verifying stock and tracking inventory
- Coordinating with employees and supporting daily operations

This experience helped me develop key skills like **responsibility**, **organization**, **problem-solving**, and **adaptability** — all of which I’m excited to apply and grow further in the tech world.
